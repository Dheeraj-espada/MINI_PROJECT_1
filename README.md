Uncovering Key Differentially Expressed Genes in Breast Cancer Subtypes Using RNA-Seq
This project aims to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across breast cancer subtypes using RNA-Seq data from the TCGA-BRCA dataset. The analysis includes differential gene expression analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and visualization techniques such as PCA, volcano plots, and heatmaps.

Key Highlights:
DEGs Identified: Key genes like TNMD, TSPAN6, DPM1, SCYL3, FIRRM, AOC1, HSPB6, ABCB5, and HOXA11 were found to be significantly dysregulated in breast cancer subtypes.

Pathway Analysis: Functional enrichment revealed involvement in immune response, drug metabolism, and hormonal regulation pathways.

Visualization: PCA, volcano plots, and heatmaps provided insights into gene expression patterns and clustering.

Applications: Potential biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets for precision medicine.

Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data preprocessing.

R (DESeq2, clusterProfiler, ReactomePA) for differential expression and pathway analysis.

TCGA-BRCA dataset and GDC API for data acquisition.

Future Directions:
Validate findings with independent datasets.

Explore non-coding RNAs and integrate clinical data for deeper insights.

This project contributes to precision medicine and cancer research by uncovering molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer.
